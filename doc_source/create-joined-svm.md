# Joining an FSx for ONTAP SVM to an Active Directory domain<a name="create-joined-svm"></a>

When you create an FSx for ONTAP storage virtual machine, you can optionally join it to your organization's Active Directory during the SVM's creation\. You create an SVM joined to an Active Directory domain in one of the following scenarios:
+ You use the **Standard create** creation option to create an FSx for ONTAP file system on the Amazon FSx console\. For more information, see [To create a file system \(console\)](managing-file-systems.md#create-MAZ-file-system-console)\.
+ You create a new SVM on an existing FSx for ONTAP file system using the Amazon FSx console, AWS CLI, or the Amazon FSx API\. For more information, see [Creating a storage virtual machine](managing-svms.md#creating-svms)\.
